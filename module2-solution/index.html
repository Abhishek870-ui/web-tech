        <h3>Fast Food</h3>

        <p>
          Fast food refers to food that can be prepared and served quickly.
          It can come from many places: sit-down restaurants, counter service,
          take-out, drive-thru, and delivery.
           Fast food is popular because the food is inexpensive, convenient,
           and tastes good
